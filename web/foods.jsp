										With temperatures in the hill state soaring high to touch the 30 degree mark, it’s time for the locals to beat the heat with street food. Even sitting inside the most posh restaurants cannot be as savouring as when you stumble upon a street side kiosk that serves crispy gol gappas filled with sweet and sour chilled pudina water.
									</p>
									<p>
									For example, the Bhihari Lal Sharma Stall at Takka Bench, above The Ridge was the first fruit chat seller in the city that started operations in 1948. The stall stands tall at the beginning of the chat street of Shimla, Takka bench, above the famous Gandhi Statue on the Ridge. Climbers to the Jakhu Temple religiously pause here for a chat break. At Rs.30, you can now beat the heat with healthy fruit in tangy chutnis.

									Next in line is British time tea stall that nestles in thick cover of forests on the thandi sadak, Chawda Maidan. The Verma tea stall, known famously as the Kewal ka Dhabba is always lively with the presence of University students, who come here to gorge on the wholesome delicacy of butter bun and tea. According to the owners of the Dhaba, Kewal and Shamsher Singh theirs is the fifth generation running this dhaba. In 1931, Lord Mountbatten, the then Viceroy of India was so impressed with their tea, that he got the shack built into a permanent structure and gave it to the family as Bakshih.
									</p>
									<p>
										Today the Dhaba runs from 7 am till 10 pm, and serves hundred of butter buns, and plenty of tea throughout the day. You can get the butter bun at Rs.14 and tea at Rs.6.

									From here I reached my personal favourite gol gappa stall situated at Navbhar Chawk, famous for St. Bede’s College. As a Bedian I couldn’t leave college without gorging on the gol gappa chat, tikka wala kulcahas and hot dogs prepared with special Indian chutnis and lots of hari mirchi (green chilli). The shack has existed for as long as I can recall, and bedians no matter in which part of the world, never forget the mouth watering chat they get here for a mere Rs. 15, and golgapas for a mere Rs.10.
